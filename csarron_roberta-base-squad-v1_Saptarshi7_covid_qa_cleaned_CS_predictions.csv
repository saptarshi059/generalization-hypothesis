While SL-SHC014-MA15 can replicate efficiently in young and aged mouse lungs, infection was attenuated, and less virus antigen was present in the airway epithelium as compared to SARS MA15, which causes lethal outcomes in aged mice"

What are important criteria for selecting vaccine delivery vectors?,Listeria,"Safety is a major concern, as even a low level of toxicity is unacceptable"
What are important criteria for selecting vaccine delivery vectors?,Listeria,"long-lasting cellular and (where appropriate) humoral immune responses to the vectored antigen must be induced following administration of these vaccines, preferably with a single dose"
What happens when a recipient of a vaccine has an immune response to the delivery vector?,modify the subsequent immune response to a vectored antigen.,"considering a vector such as Salmonella, if a host has previously been infected there will exist robust B and T memory responses, and as such, when a vaccination is delivered, an anamnestic response to the Salmonella antigens will be induced (while the response to the vectored antigen will be a primary response)"
What is the effect of host immune response to the delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination?,reduces them somewhat.,"for virally vectored antigens, the existence of pre-existing immunity to the vector (particularly neutralizing antibody) will restrict delivery of the virus into cells, thereby effectively reducing the dose of the vectored antigen. Again, this might be expected to result in a reduction in the antigenicity of the vectored antigen."
What is the effect of host immune response to the delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination?,reduces them somewhat.,"theoretically reduce the exposure of the heterologous antigen to the immune system, as the vector is rapidly cleared."
What is an example of the effect of immunity to the delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination?,Listeria,"mice that had been primed with Salmonella alone, and then boosted with Salmonella expressing tetC, induced much lower anti-tetC responses than mice that had not been primed. This argues strongly that prior immunological immunity to the vector can seriously dampen subsequent antigen-specific humoral responses."
What is the effect of host immune response to viral delivery vectors in the efficacy of vaccination?,reduces them somewhat.,"pre-existing immunity is a major obstacle of many viralvectored vaccines, such as Ad serotype 5 or herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), where the rate of seroprevalence to these viruses is very high [40-45 % and 70 % (or more) of the US population, respectively]"
What is the effect of host immune response to the viral delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination?,reduces them somewhat.,"Vector-specific antibodies may impede the induction of immune responses to the vaccine-encoded antigens, as they may reduce the dose and time of exposure of the target cells to the vaccinated antigens"
What is the effect of host immune response to the delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination?,reduces them somewhat.,"In a large-scale clinical trial (STEP) of an Ad serotype 5 (AdHu5)-based HIV-1 vaccine, the vaccines showed a lack of efficacy and tended to increase the risk of HIV-1 infection in vaccine recipients who had pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to AdHu5 ("
What are methods to avoid the effect of vector immunity on the efficacy of vaccination?,Listeria,"the use of vectors derived from nonhuman sources, using human viruses of rare serotypes (Kahl et al., 2010; Lasaro & Ertl, 2009) , heterologous prime-boost approaches (Liu et al., 2008) , homologous reimmunization (Steffensen et al., 2012) and removing key neutralizing epitopes on the surface of viral capsid proteins (Gabitzsch & Jones, 2011; Roberts et al., 2006)"
What are methods to avoid the effect of vector immune response on the efficacy of vaccination?,judicious selection of the strain/serotype,"The inhibitory effect of pre-existing immunity can also be avoided by masking the Ad vector inside dendritic cells (DCs) (Steffensen et al., 2012) . In addition, mucosal vaccination or administration of higher vaccine doses can overcome pre-existing immunity problems (Alexander et al., 2012; Belyakov et al., 1999; Priddy et al., 2008; Xiang et al., 2003) ."
"How does cell-mediated immunity to viral delivery vector, reduce the immune response to the vaccine?",a hindrance,"this is because viruses will induce neutralizing antibody on the first dose, and in subsequent doses this antibody will limit the number of transduced cells, therefore limiting the responses. This is particularly a problem with a common viral vector such as Ad, where a large proportion of the population will have immunological memory against common serotypes"
"How can vectors for which host has immunity, be used differently to increase the efficacy of vaccination?",bacterial,"it will be possible to utilize such vectors only by developing vaccines from alternative serotypes. It may be that a vector such as Pre-existing immunity against vaccine vectors attenuated influenza virus, with the ability to easily develop reassortants, will be useful in this context.

In addition, immunological memory in the form of opsonizing antibody certainly plays an important role in the early uptake of Salmonella by macrophages and DC. This may be beneficial, as the live bacterial vector used for delivery purposes harbours mutations in genes encoding proteins responsible for their survival in the animal host. This not only encumbers their ability to cause disease, making them safe live vectors, but also limits the number of replications. The presence of opsonizing antibodies should mean a higher level of bacterial uptake, leading to higher presentation to the immune system and therefore a better immune response."

What was additionally demonstrated?,"type I IFN response upon viral challenge,","the antiviral state induced by the interferon pathway protects live cells from mortality in tissue culture, resulting in in vitro epidemics of extended duration that enhance the probability of establishing a long-term persistent infection."
What do the studies suggest?,"capable of mounting a type I IFN response upon viral challenge,",that viruses evolved in bat reservoirs possessing enhanced IFN capabilities could achieve more rapid within-host transmission rates without causing pathology to their hosts. Such rapidly-reproducing viruses would likely generate extreme virulence upon spillover to hosts lacking similar immune capacities to bats.
What was the methodology for this study?,black flying fox -,"we first developed a novel, within-host, theoretical model elucidating the effects of unique bat immunity, then undertook bifurcation analysis of the model's equilibrium properties under immune absent, induced, and constitutive assumptions.

What do fits to rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cells suggest?,receptor-level cell entry incompatibility,"that the constitutive IFN-a expression characteristic of P. alecto cells may represent more of a constitutive immune priming process than a perpetual, functional, antiviral defense."
What do the findings indicate?,antiviral immune responses protect host tissues against virus-induced cell mortality,enhanced IFN-mediated immune pathways in bat reservoirs may promote elevated within-host virus replication rates prior to cross-species emergence.
What is presented in this study?,"general methods to study cross-scale viral dynamics,","general methods to study cross-scale viral dynamics, which suggest that within-host persistence is supported by robust antiviral responses characteristic of bat immune processes."

Virus","An estimated one third of the world's population (or
z500 million persons) were infected and had clinical-
ly apparent illnesses"
What was the case fatality rate in the 1918 Spanish influenza epidemic?,">2.5%,","Case-
fatality rates were >2.5%, compared to <0.1% in other
influenza pandemics"
What was the death toll in the 1918-1919 Spanish influenza epidemic?,:50 million,"Total deaths were estimated at
z50 million (577) and were arguably as high as 100 mil-
lion"
Are the modern-day influenza viruses related to the 1918 Spanish influenza virus?,6 %,"All influenza A pandemics since that time, and
indeed almost all cases of influenza A worldwide (except-
ing human infections from avian Viruses such as H5N1 and
H7N7), have been caused by descendants of the 1918
Virus, including ""drifted"" H1N1 Viruses and reassorted
H2N2 and H3N2 Viruses."
Why is the Spanish influenza virus the mother of the modern influenza viruses?,Asia,"The latter are composed of key
genes from the 1918 Virus, updated by subsequently-incor-
porated avian influenza genes that code for novel surface

and TNational Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA

proteins, making the 1918 Virus indeed the ""mother"" of all
pandemics."
When was it determined that the 1918 pandemic was caused by the h1n1 influenza virus?,"a reservoir of influenza
Virus","That question did not begin to be resolved until the 1930s,
when closely related influenza Viruses (now known to be
H1N1 Viruses) were isolated, first from pigs and shortly
thereafter from humans. Seroepidemiologic studies soon
linked both of these viruses to the 1918 pandemic"
Did Spanish influenza or swine flu or the H1N1 virus disappear in humans for some time?,1940-1960,"descendants of the 1918
Virus still persists enzootically in pigs. They probably also
circulated continuously in humans, undergoing gradual
antigenic drift and causing annual epidemics, until the
1950s. With the appearance of a new H2N2 pandemic
strain in 1957 (""Asian flu""), the direct H1N1 Viral descen-
dants 0f the 1918 pandemic strain disappeared from human
circulation entirely, although the related lineage persisted
enzootically in pigs."
When did the swine flu (Spanish influenza) virus reappear in humans?,1977,"But in 1977, human H1N1 Viruses
suddenly ""reemerged"" from a laboratory freezer (9). They
continue to circulate endemically and epidemically."
What descendant lineages of the swine flu (Spanish influenza) virus were identified in 2006?,"a reservoir of influenza
Virus","2 major descendant lineages of the 1918
H1N1 Virus, as well as 2 additional reassortant lineages,
persist naturally: a human epidemic/endemic H1N1 line-
age, a porcine enzootic H1N1 lineage (so-called classic
swine flu), and the reassorted human H3N2 Virus lineage,
which like the human H1N1 Virus, has led to a porcine
H3N2 lineage."
Are the modern descendant influenza viruses as dangerous as the 1918 parent swine flu (Spanish influenza) H1N1 virus?,"a reservoir of influenza
Virus","None of these Viral descendants, however,
approaches the pathogenicity of the 1918 parent Virus."
How dangerous are the modern H1N1 (swine flu) and the H3N2 (influenza A) viruses compared to the 1918 H1N1 (swine flu Spanish influenza) viruses?,Asia,"the human H1N1 and H3N2 lin-
eages have both been associated with substantially lower
rates ofillness and death than the virus of 1918. In fact, cur-
rent H1N1 death rates are even lower than those for H3N2
lineage strains (prevalent from 1968 until the present)."
"Are the descendant H1N1 strains of the 1918 H1N1 swine flu (Spanish influenza) virus, still prevalent?","all of its apparent descendants caused substantially
milder human disease.","H1N1 Viruses descended from the 1918 strain, as well as 
H3N2 Viruses, have now been cocirculating worldwide for
29 years and show little evidence of imminent extinction."
Is the origin and epidemiology of the 1918 swine flu (Spanish influenza) known?,"we do not know how,","ongoing studies to map Virulence
factors are yielding interesting results. The 1918 sequence
data, however, leave unanswered questions about the ori-
gin of the Virus (19) and about the epidemiology of the
pandemic."
What is the geographical origin of the H1N1 swine flu?,Spanish,"Historical and epidemiologic data are inade-
quate to identify the geographic origin of the Virus (21),
and recent phylogenetic analysis of the 1918 Viral genome
does not place the Virus in any geographic context"
Is the geographical origin of the 1918 H1N1 swine flu known?,Asia,"Confounding definite assignment of a geographic
point of origin, the 1918 pandemic spread more or less
simultaneously in 3 distinct waves during an z12-month
period in 191871919, in Europe, Asia, and North America
(the first wave was best described in the United States in
March 1918)"
What is a unique feature of the 1918 swine flu?,Enhanced virulence,"the simultaneous (or nearly simultaneous) infection
of humans and swin"
What season or time of the year do the new strains of influenza emerge?,1940-1960,"Historical records since the 16th century suggest that
new influenza pandemics may appear at any time of year,
not necessarily in the familiar annual winter patterns of
interpandemic years,"
"Once appeared, when do influenza-like diseases occur in subsequent years?",191871919,"confronted by the selection pressures of population immu-
nity, these pandemic Viruses begin to drift genetically and
eventually settle into a pattern of annual epidemic recur-
rences caused by the drifted Virus variants."
When did the first wave of the H1N1 swine flu (Spanish influenza) occur?,1918-1919,"a first or spring wave
began in March 1918 and spread unevenly through the
United States, Europe, and possibly Asia over the next 6
months"
What was the death rate in the first wave of the 1918 swine flu pandemic?,"5 7 20 times
","Illness rates were high, but death rates
in most locales were not appreciably above normal."
When were the second and the third wave of the 1918-1919 swine flu pandemic?,winter,"A sec-
ond or fall wave spread globally from September to
November 1918 and was highly fatal. In many nations, a
third wave occurred in early 1919"
What was the primary difference between the first wave and the 2nd and 3rd waves of the 1918-1919 swine flu pandemic?,"higher fre-
quency of complicated, severe, and fatal cases","the much higher fre-
quency of complicated, severe, and fatal cases in the last 2
waves."
Why the human influenza viruses do not disappear after herd immunity is developed?,Asia,"The occurrence, and to some extent the severity, of recur-
rent annual outbreaks, are driven by Viral antigenic drift,
with an antigenic variant Virus emerging to become domi-
nant"
What are the circumstances that promote the spread of the influenza virus?,Asia,"lower environ-
mental temperatures and human nasal temperatures (bene-
ficial to thermolabile Viruses such as influenza), optimal
humidity, increased crowding indoors, and imperfect ven-
tilation due to closed windows and suboptimal airflow"
Do seasonal temperatures and humidity explain the appearance of the three waves of the 1918 swine flu?,"Europe, Asia, and North America
","such factors cannot explain the 3 pandemic
waves of 1918-1919, which occurred in the spring-sum-
mer, summer-fall, and winter (of the Northern
Hemisphere), respectively. The first 2 waves occurred at a
time of year normally unfavorable to influenza Virus
spread. The second wave caused simultaneous outbreaks
in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres from
September to November."
Which virus samples from the 1918 swine flu pandemic have been identified?,6 %,"pandemic Virus samples we have
yet identified are from second-wave patients"
Are viruses in the first and third waves of the 1918 swine flu pandemic the same or derived from the virus from the second wave of the swine flu?,unknown,"nothing
can yet be said about whether the first (spring) wave, or for
that matter, the third wave, represented circulation of the
same Virus or variants of it"
Was the 1918 swine flu virus novel to humans are was it derived from older viruses?,Novel origin,"Viral sequence data now suggest that the entire 1918
Virus was novel to humans in, or shortly before, 1918, and
that it thus was not a reassortant Virus produced from old
existing strains that acquired 1 or more new genes"
Do avian flu viruses change over long periods?,little antigenic change,"Influenza Virus gene
sequences from a number offixed specimens ofwild birds
collected circa 1918 show little difference from avian
Viruses isolated today, indicating that avian Viruses likely
undergo little antigenic change in their natural hosts even
over long periods"
What is the typical age profile of mortality in influenza diseases?,">2.5%,","The curve of influenza deaths by age at death has histor-
ically, for at least 150 years, been U-shaped (Figure 2),
exhibiting mortality peaks in the very young and the very
old, with a comparatively low frequency of deaths at all
ages in between"
What was the age profile of mortality in the 1918 swine flu?,">2.5%,","age-specific death rates in the
1918 pandemic exhibited a distinct pattern that has not been
documented before or since: a ""W-shaped"" curve, similar to
the familiar U-shaped curve but with the addition of a third
(middle) distinct peak of deaths in young adults z20410
years of age"
Which age group was most susceptible to die during the 1918 swine flu pandemic?,young,"Persons 65 years of age in 1918 had a dispro-
portionately high influenza incidence"
What was the death rate among children during the 1918 swine flu pandemic?,">2.5%,","those 5 to 14
years of age accounted for a disproportionate number of
influenza cases, but had a much lower death rate from
influenza and pneumonia than other age groups."
What theory provides a partial explanation for the age-specific profile of the death rate in the 1918 swine flu pandemic?,"a reservoir of influenza
Virus","the 1918 Virus had an intrinsically high Virulence, tem-
pered only in those patients who had been born before
1889, e.g., because of exposure to a then-circulating Virus
capable of providing partial immunoprotection against the
1918 Virus strain only in persons old enough (>35 years) to
have been infected during that prior era"
Is there a difference in the pathologic feature and course of disease between modern influenza pandemics and the 1918 swine flu pandemic?,"we do not know how,","the 1918
pandemic was different in degree, but not in kind, from
previous and subsequent pandemics. Despite the extraordi-
nary number of global deaths, most influenza cases in
1918 (>95% in most locales in industrialized nations) were
mild and essentially indistinguishable from influenza cases
today."
Could the 1918 swine flu virus be controlled by modern-day drugs or vaccines?,"

mice","the 1918 and 1918-like Viruses would be
as sensitive as other typical Virus strains to the Food and
Drug Administrationiapproved antiinfluenza drugs riman-
tadine and oseltamivir."
Why was there such a high death rate in the 19118 swine flu pandemic?,"higher proportion of severe and complicated
infections of the respiratory tract,","Clinically and pathologically, these
high death rates appear to be the result of several factors,
including a higher proportion of severe and complicated
infections of the respiratory tract, rather than involvement
of organ systems outside the normal range of the influenza
Virus. Also, the deaths were concentrated in an unusually
young age group"
Is the molecular basis of human adaptation of a virus understood?,"a reservoir of influenza
Virus","While data bearing
on influenza Virus human cell adaptation (e.g., receptor
binding) are beginning to be understood at the molecular
level, the basis for Viral adaptation to efficient human-to-
human spread, the chief prerequisite for pandemic emer-
