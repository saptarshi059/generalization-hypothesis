                Set to True if the Checkpoint is a PyTorch checkpoint.

            model_args: (`optional`) Sequence of positional arguments:
                All remaning positional arguments will be passed to the underlying model's ``__init__`` method

            config: (`optional`) instance of a class derived from :class:`~my_transformers.PretrainedConfig`:
                Configuration for the model to use instead of an automatically loaded configuation. Configuration can be automatically loaded when:

                - the model is a model provided by the library (loaded with the ``shortcut-name`` string of a pretrained model), or

                an optional state dictionnary for the model to use instead of a state dictionary loaded from saved weights file.
                This option can be used if you want to create a model from a pretrained configuration but load your own weights.

            proxies: (`optional`) dict, default None:
                A dictionary of proxy servers to use by protocol or endpoint, e.g.: {'http': 'foo.bar:3128', 'http://hostname': 'foo.bar:4012'}.

            kwargs: (`optional`) Remaining dictionary of keyword arguments:
                Can be used to update the configuration object (after it being loaded) and initiate the model. (e.g. ``output_attention=True``). Behave differently depending on whether a `config` is provided or automatically loaded:

                - If a configuration is provided with ``config``, ``**kwargs`` will be directly passed to the underlying model's ``__init__`` method (we assume all relevant updates to the configuration have already been done)
                - If a configuration is not provided, ``kwargs`` will be first passed to the configuration class initialization function (:func:`~my_transformers.PretrainedConfig.from_pretrained`). Each key of ``kwargs`` that corresponds to a configuration attribute will be used to override said attribute with the supplied ``kwargs`` value. Remaining keys that do not correspond to any configuration attribute will be passed to the underlying model's ``__init__`` function.

                Set to True if the Checkpoint is a PyTorch checkpoint.

            model_args: (`optional`) Sequence of positional arguments:
                All remaning positional arguments will be passed to the underlying model's ``__init__`` method

            config: (`optional`) instance of a class derived from :class:`~my_transformers.PretrainedConfig`:
                Configuration for the model to use instead of an automatically loaded configuation. Configuration can be automatically loaded when:

                - the model is a model provided by the library (loaded with the ``shortcut-name`` string of a pretrained model), or
                - the model was saved using :func:`~my_transformers.PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained` and is reloaded by suppling the save directory.
                - the model is loaded by suppling a local directory as ``pretrained_model_name_or_path`` and a configuration JSON file named `config.json` is found in the directory.

            state_dict: (`optional`) dict:
                an optional state dictionnary for the model to use instead of a state dictionary loaded from saved weights file.
                This option can be used if you want to create a model from a pretrained configuration but load your own weights.
                In this case though, you should check if using :func:`~my_transformers.PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained` and :func:`~my_transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained` is not a simpler option.

            cache_dir: (`optional`) string:
                Path to a directory in which a downloaded pre-trained model
                configuration should be cached if the standard cache should not be used.

            force_download: (`optional`) boolean, default False:
                Force to (re-)download the model weights and configuration files and override the cached versions if they exists.

            proxies: (`optional`) dict, default None:
                A dictionary of proxy servers to use by protocol or endpoint, e.g.: {'http': 'foo.bar:3128', 'http://hostname': 'foo.bar:4012'}.
                The proxies are used on each request.

            output_loading_info: (`optional`) boolean:
                Set to ``True`` to also return a dictionnary containing missing keys, unexpected keys and error messages.

            kwargs: (`optional`) Remaining dictionary of keyword arguments:
                Can be used to update the configuration object (after it being loaded) and initiate the model. (e.g. ``output_attention=True``). Behave differently depending on whether a `config` is provided or automatically loaded:

                - If a configuration is provided with ``config``, ``**kwargs`` will be directly passed to the underlying model's ``__init__`` method (we assume all relevant updates to the configuration have already been done)
                - If a configuration is not provided, ``kwargs`` will be first passed to the configuration class initialization function (:func:`~my_transformers.PretrainedConfig.from_pretrained`). Each key of ``kwargs`` that corresponds to a configuration attribute will be used to override said attribute with the supplied ``kwargs`` value. Remaining keys that do not correspond to any configuration attribute will be passed to the underlying model's ``__init__`` function.

        Examples::

            model = TFAutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')    # Download model and configuration from S3 and cache.
            model = TFAutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('./test/bert_model/')  # E.g. model was saved using `save_pretrained('./test/saved_model/')`
            model = TFAutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', output_attention=True)  # Update configuration during loading
            assert model.config.output_attention == True
            # Loading from a TF checkpoint file instead of a PyTorch model (slower)
            config = AutoConfig.from_json_file('./tf_model/bert_tf_model_config.json')
            model = TFAutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained('./pt_model/bert_pytorch_model.bin', from_pt=True, config=config)
