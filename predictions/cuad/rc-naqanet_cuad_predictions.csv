1.       EXCLUSIVITY, TERM AND RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL

      a)       Sponsor will be the exclusive retail music store sponsor of                   the Excite Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages. Excite will                   not permit the display of advertising banners, promotional                   buttons, promotional links or other promotional materials for                   any retail sale of Music Products on the Excite Site, except                   those Music Products offered by Sponsor, nor advertising by                   any other Retail Music Store. ""Retail Music Store"" shall mean                   any entity which is primarily engaged in the sale of Music                   Products at retail to consumers. ""Music Products""     2                                                                     CONFIDENTIAL

              shall mean pre-recorded music hard goods, digitally                  distributed music (except live and/or cybercast events), music                  books (to the extent this Agreement does not conflict with                  Excite's existing agreement with Amazon.com), music-related                  t-shirts and apparel, and music videos (except live and/or                  cybercast events).

              Notwithstanding the foregoing, Excite may make available                  opportunities on the Excite Site to purchase Music Products                  from parties other than Sponsor if such Music Products are not                  available from Sponsor so long as, prior to entering into                  arrangements to make available opportunities to purchase Music                  Products from parties other than Sponsor, Excite notifies                  Sponsor of its interest in the Music Products and gives Sponsor                  thirty (30) days to make the desired Music Products available                  through the Sponsor Site. Excite and Sponsor acknowledge that                  certain market opportunities may arise in which the desired                  Music Products must be made available on less than thirty (30)                  days advance notice and will work together in good faith to                  maximize those opportunities. In no event will Excite enter                  into arrangements to make available opportunities to purchase                  Music Products from parties other than Sponsor that would                  prevent Sponsor from being the exclusive source of such Music                  Products on the Excite Site once the Music Products become                  available through Sponsor.

      b)      The term of this Agreement will begin on the Effective Date and                  will end on the second (2nd) anniversary of the Commencement                  Date. The ""Commencement Date"" means the date on which Excite                  commences delivery of Impressions (defined below). The parties                  anticipate the Commencement Date will be on or about October                  15, 1997.

Excite will credit                  Sponsor in an amount equal to [****]. This credit will be





              applied to reduce the first year exclusivity fee described in                  Section 7(b) and will be reflected in a reduction of Sponsor's                  December 31, 1997 payment to Excite described in Section 7(e).

      d)      Excite will offer Sponsor the right of first refusal to                  negotiate with Excite for renewal of this sponsorship.

Therefore, the parties agree as follows:

1.       EXCLUSIVITY, TERM AND RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL

      a)       Sponsor will be the exclusive retail music store sponsor of                   the Excite Site and the Excite Broadcast Pages.
